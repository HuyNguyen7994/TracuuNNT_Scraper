## WHAT IS IT?
A simple program to quickly parse and return data from http://tracuunnt.gdt.gov.vn  



## INSTALLATION AND USAGE GUIDE
1. Install `docker` and `docker-compose`
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to initialise the server
3. Go to http://localhost:8000/docs to use the program

## NOTE
- This is the recommended way to install and use this program. 
- If you already installed `Tensorflow` library, an CLI-program is also available in `cli-main` branch. I won't update that branch as much though, although the performance of CLI-program is much better *(need investigation)*
